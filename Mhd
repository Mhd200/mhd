Problem #1:
a- Write a method named isGreaterThan(int a, int b) that takes two integers a and b and checks whether a 
is greater than b. The method returns true if a is greater than b. Otherwise it returns false.
b- Write a program that prompts the user to enter a maxValue and a sequence of integers, the program ends 
when the user enters an integer larger than maxValue. It prints the sum of all the numbers excluding the 
maxValue and indicates whether the sum is greater than the maxValue.
Sample Run 1:
Enter a maximum number that stops the sequence: 25 
Enter a sequence of numbers until the program terminates: 15 3 19 13 7 28
The sum is 85, the sum is greater than 25
Program terminated.
Sample Run 2:
Enter a maximum number that stops the sequence: 33 
Enter a sequence of numbers until the program terminates: 35
The sum is 0, the sum is less than 33
Program terminated.
